        The show + episode links below are done with regular old HTML anchors
        below instead of #link-to for two reasons:

          1. The "What"s On" API doesn"t currently have distinct fields
          for path/domain or another good way to *build* a path that
          the Ember client would understand, so we"d have to try to
          parse it and hope that the containing client"s path matches
          what Publisher thinks the URL should be. All we get from
          publisher is an absolute URL.
          2. Shows with different domains can/will show up in here, so
          we"d need more info to support the logic to construct different
          links depending on whether or not the showUrl/episodeUrl is
          "local" to the client or should be handled elsewhere.

        The current web clients are smart enough to figure out that they
        should handle the link w/o a full reload, so just writing the
        absolute URL into the href of an anchor handles this use case.
